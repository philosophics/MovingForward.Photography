Frequently Asked Questions

1. Which device provides the best experience?
   Desktop is the best choice for a full, immersive experience. While it works on mobile, desktop offers better layout, performance, and visual fidelity.

2. Did you forget to add a background?
   No, that's intentional. The gray background represents a gray card used for exposure adjustment—consider it a playful easter egg! 😉

3. Why is the layout on a desktop browser so weird?
   The layout is designed to resemble the feeling of randomly throwing photos on a table with no particular order.
   If you were to refresh the page a couple times, you'll see that a few images are selected at random as "featured" to stand out, and the rest are shuffled. This approach ensures that every visit feels fresh, with something new to discover!

4. Why didn't you just one of many templates?
   Honestly, none of them really spoke to me. Using a pre-built template felt impersonal, like wearing a suit bought from Macy's when you want something tailor-made. Plus, if I had gone with a template, someone else would probably be using the exact same thing, and where’s the fun in that?
   Building it from scratch gave me the creative freedom to shape something that’s truly unique, with room to evolve as I come up with new ideas. There’s still more in store, especially when it comes to a storefront—stay tuned!
