# Frequently Asked Questions

#### 1. **Instagram/Facebook/etc. exist, why make a website anyway?**

Over the course of my life, I‚Äôve learned that not everyone has **the thing**! So, I built a website!

I‚Äôll still post random stuff on Instagram and similar platforms, but my portfolio can be seen by anyone‚Äîwhether they have an Instagram account or not. Whether they have a Discord account or even know what Etsy is, they can find me and what I do just by visiting my website.

But, if you don‚Äôt have internet access to check out my site... I‚Äôm not sure how to help you there. Ask a friend? Wait, how are you even reading this?? ü§î

#### 2. **Why didn't you just use one of the many available templates?**

Honestly, none of them really spoke to me. Using a pre-built template felt impersonal, like wearing a suit bought from Macy's when you want something tailor-made. Plus, if I had gone with a template, someone else would probably be using the exact same thing, and where‚Äôs the fun in that?

Building it from scratch gave me the creative freedom to shape something that‚Äôs truly unique, with room to evolve as I come up with new ideas. There‚Äôs still more to come, especially when thinking about a **storefront**‚Äîstay tuned!

#### 3. **So which device provides the best experience?**

**Desktop** is the best choice for a full, immersive experience. While it works on mobile, desktop offers better layout, performance, and visual fidelity.

---

#### 4. **Did you forget to add a background?**

No, that's intentional. The gray background represents a **gray card** used for exposure adjustment‚Äîconsider it a playful easter egg! üòâ

---

#### 5. **Why is the layout on desktop so weird?**

The layout is designed to resemble the feeling of **randomly throwing photos on a table** with no particular order.
If you were to refresh the page a couple times, you'll see that a few images are selected at random as **"featured"** to stand out, and the rest are shuffled. This approach ensures that every visit feels fresh, with something new to discover!

---

#### 6. **The website is so fast‚Äîhow??**

It‚Äôs all about optimization! Here‚Äôs what I did:

1. **Images**: Every image is converted to **WebP** format, which means they‚Äôre much smaller in size but still look great. Smaller files load faster, so you don‚Äôt have to wait forever to see the pictures.

2. Built as a **Single-Page Application**: Now, this part sounds fancy, but let me break it down quickly. Instead of making the browser reload the entire page every time you click a link, the website loads just once and then quietly swaps out the parts you need behind the scenes.

   _Think of it like a book: instead of closing the book and reopening it every time you want to read a new chapter, you just flip the page._ This makes everything feel faster and smoother‚Äîno long waits, just instant transitions!

So, with lighter images and this clever way of loading new stuff, the website feels super quick, even if you're browsing from a potato.

#### 7. **Why can‚Äôt I right click?**

Because I don‚Äôt want you to, that‚Äôs why! üòè
