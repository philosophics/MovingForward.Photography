      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
    I’m a landscape, night and street photographer based in Salt Lake City, Utah, but most of my inspiration
    comes from getting out of the city. I spend a huge amount of time chasing waterfalls, wandering deserts,
    hiking ridgelines, and waiting out sunsets in places that make you forget time for a minute.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether it’s the glow of the Milky Way, or a quiet moment in the mountains, I’m drawn to images that feel calm, intentional, and grounded. Moving Forward Photography is my way of sharing those moments. From alpine lakes and cold mornings in the Wasatch to desert light trails, long-exposure nights, and the unexpected scenes I stumble into while traveling.

      <h2>What I Shoot</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Landscapes:</strong> mountains, deserts, waterfalls, coastlines and the spaces in between.</li>
        <li><strong>Night & long exposure:</strong> stars, light trails, city glow, and any scene that comes alive when the shutter stays open.</li>
        <li><strong>City & street:</strong> moments and movement from whatever city I’m wandering through. I look for clean lines, human patterns, and the small stories happening in the chaos.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I shoot on a Sony A7 IV with a small set of lenses that cover everything from
        wide landscapes to compressed city scenes.

    <h2>How I Approach Photography</h2>
    <p>
    For me, a photo starts long before the shutter clicks. It’s planning, watching weather windows,
    scouting locations, hiking out at odd hours, and sitting through a lot of “almost” moments before
    everything finally lines up. I like images that feel calm and intentional, even when the sky is
    going absolutely wild.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m drawn to clean compositions, strong lines, and scenes that make you pause for a second and feel
    like you’re standing there hearing the water, feeling the wind, or watching the last light fade 
    off the mountains. My goal is to capture the kind of moments that stay quiet in your head long after
    you’ve left them.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of the day, I want my photos to feel honest. Like they belong to the moment, not the camera.
